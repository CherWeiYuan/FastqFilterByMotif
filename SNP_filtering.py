## Quick start

# Requirements: Biopython module

# 1. Create a folder named filtered_fastq in folder with extracted fastq files
# 2. Run function filter_SNP(file_name, marker_seq, presence, ID, allowed_mismatch)
# 3. Check printed output to see if high percentage of reads are successfully filtered
